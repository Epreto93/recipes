•	3 cups butternut squash, chopped
	•	1 Tbsp. olive oil
	•	1 cup uncooked quinoa (I used rainbow quinoa but any type will do)
	•	1½ cups water
	•	⅓ cup dried cranberries
	•	⅓ cup red onion, finely chopped
	•	3 Tbsp. toasted pumpkin seeds
	•	salt and black pepper
Balsamic Vinaigrette
	•	½ cup olive oil
	•	¼ cup balsamic vinegar
	•	1 tsp. honey
	•	1 tsp. Dijon mustard
	•	1 garlic clove, minced
	•	salt and black pepper
	•	
Preheat the oven to 400F.
In a large bowl, toss the butternut squash with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to
taste. Arrange coated squash on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast for 20-25 
minutes or until squash is tender and lightly browned.
While the squash is roasting, rinse quinoa under cold water until water runs clear. Place 
quinoa and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook 
partially covered until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
To assemble the salad, combine the cooked quinoa, roasted squash, cranberries, red 
onion, toasted pumpkin seeds in a large bowl. Add the vinaigrette and mix until 
combined. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Chill in the refrigerator for couple 
hours and serve.
Balsamic Vinaigrette
Whisk all the ingredients in a small bowl until combined. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
